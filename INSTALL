-- Installation --

These aren't actually installation instructions since no install target is in the makefile yet - joke's on you.

Razor Wire depends on OpenGL and SMFL2 - Some linux distros may have SFML1.6 as default.
CURRENTLY ONLY TESTED ON LINUX. That being said, the code doesnt contain any OS specific stuff as far as I can tell. This should compile on other systems.
If it doesn't, please tell us on the github page or email mystx@chaostheory.co.nz

After that type these commands:

cd /path/to/RazorWire/
make

Done. An executable 'RazorWire' will be in the current dir if all goes well.
