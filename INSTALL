-- Installation --

These aren't actually installation instructions since no install target is in the makefile yet - joke's on you.

Razor Wire depends on OpenGL and SMFL - Have these installed.

After that type these commands:

cd /path/to/RazorWire/
make

Done. An executable 'RazorWire' will be in the current dir if all goes well.
