-- Installation --

These aren't actually installation instructions since no install target is in the makefile yet - joke's on you.

Razor Wire depends on OpenGL and SMFL1.6 - Be careful, some distributions have SFML1.99 as the default, and you may have to get SFML from the website.
CURRENTLY ONLY TESTED ON LINUX. That being said, the code doesnt contain any OS specific stuff as far as I can tell. This should compile on other systems.

After that type these commands:

cd /path/to/RazorWire/
make

Done. An executable 'RazorWire' will be in the current dir if all goes well.
